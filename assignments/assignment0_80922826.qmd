# Introduction
Hey, my name is **Eryk Halicki**, I'm a third year CS student at UBCO. I'm currently a technical director at the Okanagan Marine Robotics club, and am very interested in *robotics* and *ML / AI*, particularly the intersection between the two.

![Photo of my clubs AUV](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f0621d_34da9addbeef4f358d82a494528bce26~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_640,h_742,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/f0621d_34da9addbeef4f358d82a494528bce26~mv2.jpg)
Above is a photo of my clubs robot / AUV (autonomous underwater vehicle) from 2024.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
#(1 point) Load in the tidyverse package. Be sure to follow the best practices as described in class/lab.
#(1 point) When you load this package, several startup messages are printed to the screen. Edit the code chunk options so these messages are suppressed.
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
# (2 points) Download the data CSV file from https://irene.vrbik.ok.ubc.ca/data/sales_data.csv and save it in a subdirectory within your assignment folder (refer to Lab 0 for recommended folder setup). Load the dataset into R using a relative path and save it to an R object (naming of your choice).
sales_data <- read.csv("/Users/erykhalicki/Documents/School/UBC/year3/DATA311/datasets/sales_data.csv")

#(1 point) Display a preview of your data by using the head() and str() functions on your data frame.
head(sales_data)
str(sales_data)

#(1 point) Identify and remove any duplicate rows in the dataset using appropriate R functions.
unique_sales_data <- unique(sales_data)

#(1 point) Check for missing values in the dataset.
anyNA(unique_sales_data)

#(1 point) Filter the dataset to display only the sales made in New York.
new_york_sales <- filter(unique_sales_data, Store.Location == "New York")
new_york_sales
#(1 point) Identify the date on which the highest total sale was recorded in New York.
sorted_new_york_sales <- arrange(new_york_sales, desc(Total.Sales))
highest_sale_date <- sorted_new_york_sales[1,]$Date
sprintf("Largest sale in New York occured on: %s", highest_sale_date)

#(1 point) Determine the most frequently used payment method by customers.
# referenced https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2547402/how-to-find-the-statistical-mode for mode calculation
payment_methods <- select(unique_sales_data, Payment.Method)
unique_payment_methods <- unique(payment_methods)

mode_payment_method <- unique_payment_methods[which.max(tabulate(match(payment_methods$Payment.Method, unique_payment_methods$Payment.Method))),]

sprintf("%s is the most common payment method", mode_payment_method)

#(2 points) Create a histogram of Customer Age and label the x-axis as “Customer Age”. Adjust the plot dimensions so that it is taller than it is wide.
par(pin = c(2, 2.25))  
hist(unique_sales_data$Customer.Age, asp=5.0, xlim=c(20,50), ylim=c(0, 10), xlab="Customer Age")

#plot(histogram, , , )

#(2 points) Create a scatter plot with Quantity Sold on the x-axis and Price on the y-axis. Ensure that all axis labels are clear and readable. Title the plot “Relationship between Quantity and Price” and label the chunk using the naming convention that facilitates cross-referencing.

#(2 points) Based on the scatter plot from the previous question, describe any apparent relationship between Price and Quantity Sold. Include a cross-reference to the figure number in your response.

#(1 point) Submit both your rendered HTML and the .qmd source file to Canvas for grading. Verify that your HTML document displays as expected before submission.
