Since the assingment states we will use "logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and discriminant analysis to build predictive models" I believe this is A (Classification), C(Supervised), and D (Unsupervised). This is because logistic regression and LDA / QDA are supervised classification methods, and KNN is an unsupervised method. Furthermore, we are predicting a binary value (churn), indicating classification.

```{r}
telco <- read.csv('/Users/erykhalicki/Documents/School/UBC/year3/DATA311/datasets/Telco-Customer-Churn.csv')

# Binary categorical columns -> factor
telco[c("gender", "Partner", "Dependents", "PhoneService", "PaperlessBilling", "Churn")] <- 
  lapply(telco[c("gender", "Partner", "Dependents", "PhoneService", "PaperlessBilling", "Churn")], factor)

# SeniorCitizen is coded as 0/1 but should be factor
telco$SeniorCitizen <- factor(telco$SeniorCitizen, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("No", "Yes"))

# Unordered categorical with 3+ levels
telco[c("MultipleLines", "InternetService", "OnlineSecurity", "OnlineBackup", 
        "DeviceProtection", "TechSupport", "StreamingTV", "StreamingMovies", "PaymentMethod")] <- 
  lapply(telco[c("MultipleLines", "InternetService", "OnlineSecurity", "OnlineBackup", 
                 "DeviceProtection", "TechSupport", "StreamingTV", "StreamingMovies", "PaymentMethod")], factor)

# Ordered categorical
telco$Contract <- factor(telco$Contract, 
                         levels = c("Month-to-month", "One year", "Two year"),
                         ordered = TRUE)

# customerID stays as character (it's an identifier)
# tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges stay numeric
cleaned_telco <- na.omit(telco)
str(telco)
```
Our dataset has `r nrow(telco)` rows before cleaning and `r ncol(telco)` columns. `r nrow(telco) - nrow(cleaned_telco)` rows contain NA values and will be removed.
